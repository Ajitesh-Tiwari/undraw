## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'undraw'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install undraw

## Usage

Browse to find the [images](https://undraw.co/illustrations) that fit your needs. Take advantage of the on-the-fly color image generation to match your brand identity.

**hint: downcase the svg title and replace space with underscore. eg: `Features Overview` to `features_overview`

```ruby
# default color
<%= undraw("features_overview") %>
```

```ruby
# set size 
<%= undraw("features_overview", color: "#3f51b5", size: "350*150") %>
```

```ruby
# set id
<%= undraw("building", color: "#ff6347", id: "undraw-building") %>
```

```ruby
# set class
<%= undraw("designer_life", color: "#ff6347", class: "undraw-designer-life") %>
```

## Update
Run bundle update to latest gem release

```$ bundle update undraw```

Due the license issue, any new illustrations release are no longer added to this gems and existing assets might be removed in a future release.
You need to manually download preferred svg file and put on:

```\vendor\images\undraw\<asset-name>.svg```
